      <h1>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the Howwe Technologies AB Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use our services. Last updated: [November 2023].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Information We Collect</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On our public webpage</strong>: We may collect your name, email address, and, if voluntarily provided, your telephone number, for purposes such as responding to inquiries, registration for marketing events, or other related activities.</li>
<li><strong>Within our software</strong>: We collect your name, email address, and technical data, which may include your IP address, unique device ID, network and computer performance, browser type, language, and operating system. This data is essential for us to provide our Service to you.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to Legal Requests and Preventing Harm</strong>: We prioritize the privacy and security of your personal data. However, under specific circumstances, we may be legally required to share your personal data. This would only occur in response to legal mandates, such as compliance with search warrants or court orders. Our actions in these scenarios are strictly limited to what is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. User Responsibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are responsible for any personal data they enter into the application, especially in free text forms. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and rights to share any data you input.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Administration and Communication:</strong> We use your data to administer your account, enable and provide our services, integrate with third-party services, and personalize and improve your experience. We may also send you alerts or messages, including marketing communications related exclusively to our own products and services.</li>
<li><strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>For Customers</strong>: If we have a customer agreement with you, we will store your personal data for the duration of the agreement and for six (6) months following its termination.</li>
<li><strong>For Website Visitors</strong>: If you visit our website and provide personal data (e.g., for inquiries or event registrations), we retain this data to support our sales processes. We maintain this data for as long as it remains relevant to our business needs and sales cycle. You have the right to request access to your personal data, rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing at any time. Please contact us if you wish to exercise these rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Global Login</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All users access our services through a single global login page at <a href="http://login.howwe.io/">login.howwe.io</a>. By using Howwe, you acknowledge that our login provider, Auth0, is located in the EU and may require basic user information for authentication purposes. This login mechanism is separate from where your Howwe data is stored.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Data Storage and GDPR Compliance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We primarily process and store your Howwe data in the European Union. However, we have the capability to offer regional data storage for Howwe data, allowing customers to choose their base region for data hosting based on their requirements. Please note that the regions available for selection are determined by the regions Google Cloud currently supports. We ensure that our policy fully complies with the GDPR and local rulesets of each market we operate in. For EU citizens working for non-EU companies, while we uphold the standard rights such as the right to be forgotten, it is the responsibility of the user and their employer to ensure that their data is processed in accordance with GDPR regulations.</li>
